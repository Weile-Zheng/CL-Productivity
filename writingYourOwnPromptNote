Note that the \ before $(git_status) is absolutely vital for auto updating the 
prompt without need to source the zshrc file. 
export PROMPT="%{$reset_color%}%n%{$reset_color%}@%{$fg[cyan]%}%m %{$fg[cyan]%}%1|%~ \$(git_status) %{$fg[white]%}%# "

Why is it that?

When you load up your terminal, your zshrc file is automatically executed, 
(Or when you source it explicitly), and the $(function) is executed, and became 
part of PROMPT variable for the entire lifetime of this senssion. However,
when you escape it, the function calling will be delayed, where However, when the prompt is displayed,
Zsh STILL interprets the \$(...) as command substitution,
 even though the dollar sign is escaped.
